This was my first HTML project. I created a simple google search page with the ability to allow different features(links&buttons) to be interactive in the future

Things I learned:

HTML Basics:
-Meta data is created in <head><head/>
-All the content is in the body, <body><body/>
-<nav><nav/> is for when you want something to be directed/navigated to another page/screen
-background: (color)- if using specific hexcodes use '#'
-color: (implies the color of the text)
-cmd,shft,v for preview inside vscode
-cmd c, cmd l to open the preview in the webpage
-To accomodate your page to mobile devices, inspect the page and change the device view



Notes: 
-Think about the layout of the page
-What big sections do you need, then break down each componenet in each section
